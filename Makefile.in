# In-Makefile to generate 'trafinject' with XML-enhancements 
#
# 1. Ensure <cURL-devel> is installed on your system. If needed
# can be downloaded from: http://curl.haxx.se/download.html,
# but better is to use platform package mnager (dpkg, apr-get, etc).

# 2. Ensure <libxml2> is installed on your system. If needed
# can be downloaded from: http://www.xmlsoft.org/downloads.html
# (optionally: git clone git://git.gnome.org/libxml2). 
# Compile (autogen.sh) without 'Python' support, and
# install ('make install').
#
# 3. Provide flags -I<dir> and -L<dir> once installed
# into not default 'lib' and 'include' dirs of compiler.
